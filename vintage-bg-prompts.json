      "positive": "Authentic 1890s tintype photograph of a lone photographer hunched over a large format wooden camera on a heavy tripod in a cramped dimly lit photography studio. Glass plate negatives scattered on a wooden workbench beside chemical developing trays. A single gas lamp mounted on the wall casts dramatic warm side-lighting from the upper center, creating deep pools of shadow that fill the edges of the frame. The photographer's face is hidden beneath the camera's dark cloth. Victorian-era clothing, leather apron. The entire scene is concentrated in the center of the frame, surrounded by deep atmospheric darkness at all edges. Heavy photographic grain, sepia-toned, foxing spots and water stains on the print surface, narrow tonal range from chemical fading, yellowed emulsion, slight vignetting at corners, uneven chemical development marks. Shot on wet collodion process glass plate negative, scanned with visible dust and scratches.",

A director seated in a canvas chair center-left, gesturing toward actors on a small elevated stage. Camera operator at a hand-cranked motion picture camera on a heavy wooden tripod center-right. A single powerful arc lamp above creates a cone of bright light on the stage area in the center of the frame, with the surrounding studio falling into deep darkness. 5-6 crew members visible as dark silhouettes against the bright stage light. Rigging and wooden lighting frames visible overhead. All key figures clustered in the center of the composition, edges dissolve into atmospheric studio darkness and shadow. Fine photographic grain, gelatin silver print texture, chemical development marks along print edges, slightly uneven tonal exposure, period-accurate 1920s clothing and equipment. Scanned vintage print with edge wear and handling marks.",

An audio engineer seated at a large analog mixing console in the center of the frame, viewed from behind at a slight elevated angle. The console features rows of bakelite knobs, analog VU meters with glowing needles, patch bays with neatly routed cables. The engineer wears headphones around his neck, leaning forward with focused concentration. A warm overhead lamp creates a pool of light on the console surface and the engineer's hands in the center of the frame. The glowing VU meters create small scattered points of warm light across the center. Above and around the console, the room falls into deep shadow — dark walls, equipment racks barely visible, acoustic treatment panels. All visual interest concentrated in the center 50% of the composition, surrounded by atmospheric darkness. Faded black and white photograph, slightly yellowed with age, fingerprint smudges near corners, subtle chemical stains on print surface, period-accurate 1940s equipment and clothing, fine grain structure of wartime-era photographic paper.",
